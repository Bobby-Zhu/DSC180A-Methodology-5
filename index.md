What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?

The most interesting part is talking with a senior nurse (domain expert) who discuss a lot of details of UCSD hosptial proctoal on treating a sepsis patients, and we brainstorm together to figure out if there is any point in this process can be optimzed. In other word, knowing the real world healthcare scenario is the most interesting part. 

Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
I want to investigate more if we can come up with a sepsis index for patients which can remind healthcare workers which patients would need more attention, since early detection is the key in the treatement of Sepsis

What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
I don't have much change to make for current project, since we are replicating a paper on sepsis. 

What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?

I am interseting building both frontend and backend using code to display our product.
